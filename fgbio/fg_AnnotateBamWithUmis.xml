  <help><![CDATA[Annotates existing BAM files with UMIs (Unique Molecular Indices, aka Molecular IDs, Molecular barcodes) from a separate FASTQ file. Takes an existing BAM file and a FASTQ file consisting of UMI reads, matches the reads between the files based on read names, and produces an output BAM file where each record is annotated with an optional tag (specified by attribute) that contains the read sequence of the UMI. Trailing read numbers (/1 or /2) are removed from FASTQ read names, as is any text after whitespace, before matching.

At the end of execution, reports how many records were processed and how many were missing UMIs. If any read from the BAM file did not have a matching UMI read in the FASTQ file, the program will exit with a non-zero exit status. The --fail-fast option may be specified to cause the program to terminate the first time it finds a records without a matching UMI.

In order to avoid sorting the input files, the entire UMI fastq file is read into memory. As a result the program needs to be run with memory proportional the size of the (uncompressed) fastq.]]></help>
